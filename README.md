### METRIC

METRIC was developed for estimating evapotranspiration from landsat imagery and weather station data. It includes a short tutorial on the download method of properly formatted weather data. The easiest way to interface with the METRIC model is to add the python toolbox file "pyt" in arcmap and follow the user prompts.
